<p><strong>Application of this Notice</strong></p>
<p>This Notice covers third parties that we do business with, may do business with or are in some other way connected to our business. This includes suppliers, sub-contractors, contingent, temporary, or contract workers, consultants, professional advisors, interns, visitors to our offices, yards or rigs, customers, and investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms of this Notice may be supplemented by any other privacy notice or statement we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you.</p>
<p><strong>What does this Notice cover?</strong></p>
<p>This Notice explains how we collect, use, store, transfer and secure the personal information of the third parties we do business with, as outlined above.</p>
<p>You should read this Notice so you know what we are doing with your personal information or the personal information you might provide on behalf of someone else. Where you give us personal information about another person, in doing so you confirm you have the lawful basis to provide the personal information and have brought this Notice to their attention, including obtaining their explicit consent where necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Processing the personal information of children</strong></p>
<p>We do not intentionally collect the personal information of individuals under 18years of age. If you wish to contact Transocean in a way which requires you to submit your personal information, please get your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
<p>You directly provide Transocean with most of the personal information we collect but we may also obtain your personal information from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal sources as a result of your interactions with us;</li>
<li>Your employer or the company for whom you work;</li>
<li>Third parties as appropriate to the relationship with you, including recruitment agencies, references or other background, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption and know your customer checks or medical screening checks; and</li>
<li>Publicly available resources such as the internet and social networking sites such as LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What personal information do we process about you? </strong></p>
<p>The type of personal information we may collect about you generally falls into the categories below. Note that the following list of examples is non-exclusive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Information: </strong>including name, date of birth, home address, email address, vehicle registration numbers, and phone numbers, only if necessary. Visitors to our facilities offshore may also be asked to provide emergency contact and next of kin information.</li>
<li><strong>Business Development, Business Contact and Other Information: </strong>including name, business address, email address, job title, marital and family status, and other information related to you and your current or potential work with us. This may also include bank account information if you are providing us with goods or services.</li>
<li><strong>Background Screening: </strong>We may collect background information about you through our screening process to meet our legal obligations or to safeguard our people and our assets and this may include information about criminal convictions and offences*. We often do this to meet our obligations under anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions laws, and anti-money laundering laws. This screening will often take place before we enter into, and periodically after entering into a business relationship with you. Background screening includes gathering information from you and other publicly available sources including public filings, public records, and media searches.</li>
<li><strong>Health &amp; Safety Information*: </strong>Health and safety in our business operations is critical to our mission. If you are a visitor to one of our offshore locations, we may collect and process medical information about you in order to comply with the law and to ensure your safety and the safety of others. This medical screening includes medical information about your health, such as any prescribed medications, medical condition or health, accident, and sickness, and vaccination records, including COVID vaccination records, and disability information. In some jurisdictions, this can also include information from closed-circuit television (&ldquo;CCTV&rdquo;), monitored for the purpose of ensuring the security and health and safety of individuals at our premises. Any personal information collected through CCTV monitoring will be stored and maintained in accordance with Transocean&rsquo;s Video Monitoring Policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>We rely on one or more of the following lawful grounds for processing your personal information. These grounds may vary by jurisdiction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we need to perform a contract we have with you.</li>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. In general terms, we rely on this basis for processing your personal information in the normal course of our business operations, to interact with you in the course of those operations and to manage our business operations in the most effective way.</li>

We have put in place procedures to deal with suspected personal information breaches and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Who will we share your personal information with?</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may need to share the personal information we process with others where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the working relationship with you or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.</p>
<p>Where we engage third-party service providers, your personal information is exclusively processed for the purposes above and only shared on a strict business need to know basis.

<li>To other third parties as directed by you.

</ul>
<p><strong>Transfers of your personal information to other countries</strong></p>
<p>Due to the multinational character of the Transocean group, we may transfer, and process, your personal information within the Transocean group or to authorized third parties outside of your country. Where this is the case, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected when transferring personal information by implementing technical and organisational security measures and using the standard contractual clauses approved by the competent authority, such as the European Commission, which contractually ensure the protection of your personal information, supplemented (where necessary) by appropriate additional safeguard measures to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects applicable data protection law.</p>
<p>If you require further information about any these safeguards, you can request it from <span><a href="mailto:dataprivacy@reusssubsealtd.co.uk">dataprivacy@reusssubsealtd.co.uk</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>When we transfer data within the Transocean Group we use standard contractual clauses in the form approved by the European Commission <strong>(</strong><strong>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004D0915</strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>How long do we hold your personal information?</strong></p>
<p>We will keep your personal information for only as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it. We may keep it longer to satisfy any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine how long to keep personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
