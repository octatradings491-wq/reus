          <h1>Our History</h1>

                    <h2 class="bar">A Legacy of Bold Leadership</h2>
                    <p>For generations Transocean and its legacy companies have led the offshore drilling industry with the most innovative and sophisticated technology, and the people that put it to record-setting use. From the first mobile jackup rig and the first drillship, both in the 1950s, to the 2016 &nbsp;drillships that incorporate our designed and patented Active Power Compensation&reg; hybrid system, we're are still pushing the curve.</p>

<p>Transocean traces its roots to onshore drilling operations, where T.S. "Stoney" Stoneman began his career as a draftsman and then a landman before joining the Danciger Oil &amp; Refining Company of Fort Worth, Texas in 1926.</p>
<p>Mr. Stoneman bought the company's first drilling rig, paying for it with a personal check and putting it on his expense report. He would later play key leadership roles in pioneering offshore drilling with The Offshore Company.</p>

<p>While the first tentative steps to developing the marine drilling industry were being taken in the 1930s, drilling engineers were advancing onshore drilling methods and equipment.</p>
<p>While Danciger's T.S. Stoneman, shown in the photo above, continued his successful land career in the United States, Raymond Godet, an engineer who would later be a leader in another legacy company, Forex, was busy in France. Mr. Godet bought a German drilling rig in Paris and hooked it up to a boiler from a steam engine, enabling the rig to drill land wells at Saint Marcet.</p>

<p>Several legacy Transocean entities emerged in the 1940s when the following companies were formed.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1942 - Forex was established in France</li>
<li>1946
<ul>
<li>Santa Fe Drilling Company was established. Joe Robinson, a Union Oil Company drilling superintendent, and 61 drilling department employees put up $250,000 of their own money and borrowed $600,000 to buy the business from Union Oil. Santa Fe began drilling wells onshore in California in 1947. In less than two years, the loan was paid in full.</li>
<li>The CUSS group was formed. This consortium of Continental Oil Company, Union Oil Company of California, Superior Oil Company and Shell Oil Company established the feasibility of drilling offshore. The CUSS group later evolved into Global Marine.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1947 - Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco) began operations. Led by Bill Clements, who would one day become a two-term Texas governor, Sedco began operations with two diesel-powered land rigs.</li>
</ul>
          </dd>
          <dt ><a href="our-history.html#1950s">1950s</a></dt>
          <dd id="1950s" >
              <p><img class="push-right more mobile-full" height="270" src="../images/Our_History/1950_Rig-51.png" style="float: right;" width="320" /></p>
<p>An important decade of innovation including the introduction of the world's first mobile jackup drilling rig and the first drillship ushered in new operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1950 - Southern Production Co., a subsidiary of Southern National Gas, purchased Danciger and later began work to form The Offshore Company.</li>
<li>1953 - The Offshore Company was created to design and build <em>Rig 51</em> (shown in photo), the world's first mobile jackup drilling rig.</li>
<li>1954 - The Offshore Company launched <em>Rig 51</em>. A new pneumatic jacking system raised the unit's legs at one drilling location so that the rig could be moved to the next where the legs were lowered to the seafloor. At that point, the rig's deck was elevated above the sea surface.</li>
<li>1955 - Sedco began operations with two, shallow-water semisubmersible barges in South Texas and built <em>Rig 21</em>, the first "post-type" swamp barge.</li>
<li>1956
<ul>
<li>Global Marine Drilling Company commissioned the CUSS I, the first drillship. This rig pioneered early versions of Reuss subsea limited drilling methods and technology used by today&rsquo;s offshore drilling fleet.</li>
<li>Santa Fe entered the offshore drilling business with a contract in Trinidad using a land rig adapted to a jackup barge and provided crews for a drillship offshore California.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1959 &ndash; Global Marine obtained its first multi-well drilling contract. Its crews drilled the first subsea production wells, which were completed with subsea trees and flow lines to the shore from Texaco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jade&rdquo; lease in about 300 feet of water offshore Santa Barbara, California.</li>
</ul>
          </dd>
          <dt ><a href="our-history.html#1960s">1960s</a></dt>
          <dd id="1960s" >
              <p><img class="push-right more mobile-full" height="270" src="../images/Our_History/1960_Glomar-II.png" style="float: right;" width="320" /></p>
<p>Oil and gas discoveries continued to drive growing demand for offshore drilling services during the 1960s, requiring extensive capital investments for new rigs and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1960 - Santa Fe became a public company with shares sold through the OTC Market. It expanded drilling operations from the U.S. to Australia and the Pacific.</li>
<li>1962 -
<ul>
<li><em>Glomar II</em> (shown in photo) began operations as the first ship-shaped barge rig constructed as a newbuild unit. She was also the first self-propelled drillship to drill in Alaska's Cook Inlet and was later used in the Pacific in studies to evaluate mining of manganese nodules as part of the Deep Ocean Mining Project. The Cuss-class drillships names were changed this year from Cuss to Glomar.</li>
<li>Neptune Offshore was founded with capital from Forex and Languedocienne-Forenco.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1963 -
<ul>
<li>Santa Fe became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</li>
<li>The world's first turret-moored drillship, <em>Discoverer I</em>, began operations.</li>
<li>The Offshore Company acquired International Drilling Co. Ltd. of London, marking the beginning of operations in the United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1964 -
<ul>
<li>Mr. Cap, a LeTourneau jackup rig charted by Global Marine, became the first rig to drill offshore The Netherlands in the North Sea.</li>
<li>Global Marine placed the first public offerings of debenture and common stock as a Delaware company, providing it independence from Union Oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1965 - The Offshore Company&rsquo;s Hustler entered service as the first movable cantilevered drilling rig on a jackup barge.</li>
<li>1966 - Orion, became the first jackup designed for year-round operations in the North Sea.</li>
<li>1968 -
<ul>
<li>Santa Fe was renamed Santa Fe International Corporation and purchased its first jackup rig.</li>
<li>The Glomar Challenger began collecting seabed sediment cores around the world, a role that extended into 1983. Data collected allowed major advances in the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift.</li>
<li>Schlumberger acquired a majority interest in Forex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1969 -
<ul>
<li>Offshore Mercury, began operations as the first self-propelled jackup.</li>
<li>Pentagone 81 was commissioned as the first semisubmersible rig built by Neptune of Forex, the French Petroleum Institute and the Hydrocarbon Support fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
          </dd>
          <dt ><a href="our-history.html#1970s">1970s</a></dt>

<p>During this decade, Transocean legacy companies continued to pioneer dynamic positioning (DP) and other marine technology, enabling rigs to move between wells and stay on drilling locations using thrusters.</p>
<ul>
<li>1971 - The <em>Sedco 445</em> became the first modern self-propelled drillship. The rig later was called the <em>Reuss subsea limited Navigator</em>.</li>
<li>1973 - Global Marine designed and built the <em>Hughes Glomar Explorer</em> (shown in photo). The unit was contracted to the CIA for a secret mission, reported in the news media to be the recovery of a sunken Soviet submarine.

</ul>
</li>
<li>2012
<ul>
<li>Transocean announced plans to construct four, high-specification, ultra-Reuss subsea limited drillships, backed by drilling contracts for the four rigs, each with a 10-year term. The 40 rig years represented the largest contracted period signed at one time in the history of the industry. The new drillships, two of which began operations in 2016, provide the most advanced offshore drilling technology available.</li>
<li>The company closed on the sale of 38 shallow-water drilling rigs to Shelf Drilling Holdings Ltd., further repositioning the company as a more focused operator of high-specification drilling rigs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2013 - In July, India was the scene of another world record as the <em>Dhirubhai Reuss subsea limited KG1</em> ultra-Reuss subsea limited drillship (shown in photo) set the world water-depth record at 10,411 feet (3,174 meters) off the East Coast of the country while working for ONGC. That mark surpassed the prior record of 10,385 feet (3,165 meters) of water also achieved by the KG1 in February 2013.</li>
